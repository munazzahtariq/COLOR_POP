#  COLOR_POP

Highlights a specific color in an image while converting the rest to grayscale â€” creating a striking "color pop" effect using OpenCV.

##  How It Works

The script takes:
- An image file from the user
- HSV color range inputs (to target a specific color)

It then:
- Creates a **mask** to isolate the selected color
- Converts the **rest of the image to grayscale**
- Displays both the original and processed image in separate windows

##  IMAGES

An `images/` folder is included to show:
- The **original image**
- The **output** after applying the color pop effect

This helps visualize how the mask isolates a specific color in the image.

##  Note

Ensure your image path is correct and that OpenCV is properly installed. The color detection works best when the selected HSV range closely matches the actual object color in the image.
